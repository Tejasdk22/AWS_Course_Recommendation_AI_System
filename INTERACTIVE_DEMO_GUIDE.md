### **Option 2: Python Ask**
```bash
source bedrock_env/bin/activate
python3 ask_agent.py "I want to become a software engineer"
```

### **Option 3: Full Interactive Demo**
```bash
source bedrock_env/bin/activate
python3 interactive_demo.py
```

## 📝 **Example Prompts to Try**

### **Data Science:**
```bash
./ask.sh "I want to become a data scientist"
./ask.sh "How do I become a machine learning engineer?"
./ask.sh "What courses should I take for data analysis?"
```

### **Software Engineering:**
```bash
./ask.sh "I want to become a software engineer"
./ask.sh "How do I become a full-stack developer?"
