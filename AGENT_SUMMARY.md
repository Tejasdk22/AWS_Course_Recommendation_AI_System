## üîÑ Agent Orchestration

### **Concurrent Execution**
All agents run **simultaneously** for maximum efficiency:
```python
# All agents execute in parallel
job_market_task = asyncio.create_task(job_market_agent.run())
course_catalog_task = asyncio.create_task(course_catalog_agent.run())
career_matching_task = asyncio.create_task(career_matching_agent.run())
project_advisor_task = asyncio.create_task(project_advisor_agent.run())
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **JobMarketAgent** ‚Üí Job market data
2. **CourseCatalogAgent** ‚Üí Course catalog data
3. **CareerMatchingAgent** ‚Üê Uses data from agents 1 & 2
4. **ProjectAdvisorAgent** ‚Üê Uses data from agent 3
5. **Unified Response** ‚Üê Combines all agent outputs

### **Session Management**
- Each query gets a unique session ID
- Agents maintain state across requests
- Data is cached for performance optimization

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Base Agent Architecture**
All agents inherit from `BaseAgent` class:
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bedrock_client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__)
    
    async def run(self):
        # Override in subclasses
        pass
```

### **AWS Bedrock Integration**
- **Model**: Claude 3 Sonnet
- **Purpose**: Natural language processing and analysis
- **Features**: Advanced reasoning and content generation

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues if individual agents fail
- **Fallback Data**: Uses sample data when external sources fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks all agent activities
